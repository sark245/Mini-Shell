# Mini-Shell
An interactive Shell program.


Design and implement a simple, interactive shell program that prompts the user for a command, parses the command, and then executes it with a child process by looking at PATH environment variable. 
Implemented running of command in background also. Properly handling Ctrl-c, Ctrl-d signals.
