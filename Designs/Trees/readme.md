## Purpose or Motivation

Well, I will try to add new design problems in this folder.

The first one I added was to Serialise and Deserialise an N-Ary Tree. 

 **Serialising** is to store a Tree on a file. This task is easy for say Binary Search Tree or Complete Binary Tree. For BST we have the option to  store
 just the preorder traversal as recovery from that for a unique tree is trivial. In case of Complete BInary Tree, Level order traversal does the task.  
 
**Deserialising** is just to read that tree from the file and form the structue. 

The code is quite simple enough to understand. _We simply add a marker whenever we want to denote the end of children._


30/7/2020: Added Inorder Traversal of Binary Tree using Stack instead of Recursion
ToDO: Use this method to implement an iterator for Binary Tree..
