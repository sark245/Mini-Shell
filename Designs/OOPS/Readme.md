## OOPS Concepts and Design Problems

### 1. Multilevel Inheritence and Virtual Base Class
A derived class with two base classes and these two base classes have one common base class is called multipath inheritance. An ambiguity  
can arrise in this type of inheritance. Virtual base classes are used in virtual inheritance in a way of preventing multiple “instances” of a given  
class appearing in an inheritance hierarchy when using multiple inheritances.


There are 2 ways to avoid this ambiguity:  
  a. Use scope resolution operator  
  b. Use virtual base class
